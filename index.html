         As a team we captured video on campus that played around with light and shadows. 
         Along this journey, I found that most of the light source was made by electricy because it was shot at night.
         It inspired me to think about our society and how we function with and without electricity/devices. 
         We almost panic in an event of a world crisis, or emergency. 
         It also brought me back to when the power grid was shut off in San Diego for a whole day. 
         I took notice on how much we rely on this source for survival.
        I t scares me to think our society today might go mad in a world without technology and electricity. 
        Could we make it if we all fell off the grid? I started to sourced some videos from CreativeCommons
         to interlace some found footage of natural disasters or states of emergency with the captured video.
         I then proceeded to use Adobe Premiere to make this project whole.
